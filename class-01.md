# Intro to react and components

## Component Based Architecture
- a modular, portable, replaceable, and reusable set of well-defined functionality that encapsulates its implementation and exporting it as a higher-level interface
- a software object, intended to interact with other components, encapsulating certain functionality or a set of functionalities
- a unit of composition with a contractually specified interface and explicit context dependencies only
- Views of a component: 
  - object-oriented: compnent is a set of one or more cooperating classes
  - conventional: component is a functional element or module of a program that integrates the processing logic, internal data structures, and an interface which enables the component to be invoked and data to be passed to it
  - process-related: instead of creating components from scratch, the system builds from existing components maintained in a library
- component characteristics
  - reusability
  - replaceability 
  - not context specific
  - extensible
  - encapsulated
  - independent
- principles of component-based design
- component level design guidelines
- conducting component-level design
- component advantages
  - ease of deployment
  - ease of development
  - reduced cost
  - reusable
  - modification of technical complexity
  - reliability
  - system maintenance and evolution
  - independent

## What is props?
- React is a component based library which divides the UI into reusable pieces, PROPS is how data is passed between components
  - data is passed one-way, from parent to child
- defining attributes and data
- passing data using props
- rendering props data
