- 6 steps to make a wireframe
    1. Research
        - wireframing isn't the first step in the process of UX design
        - who is my audience?
        - detail requirements
        - create user personas and define use cases
        - more industry and competitor research
    2. Prepare my research for quick referrence
        - cheatsheet for business and user goals, personas, use cases, etc.
    3. Map out user flow
        - how many screens do i need to produce?
        - the flow i expect my user to follow
        - where are they coming from? where do i want them to go?
    4. Draft > Draw/Sketch > Illustrate
        - put pen to paper
        - how can i organize the content to support my users' goals?
        - which information should be most prominent?
        - what will the user expect to see on certain areas of the page?
        which buttons or touch points does the user need to complete the desired actions?
    5. Add detail and test
        - usability conventions
        - simple instructional wording for calls-to-action
        - trust-building elements
        - tooltips to indicate any functionality that could be included in a prototype transition
        - user tests
    6. Turn wireframes into prototypes
- Key principles
    1. Clarity
    2. Confidence
    3. Keep It Simple Stupid

## HTML Basics
- what is it?
- Anatomy of an element
    1. the opening tag: wrapped in <opening and closing angle bracket>
    2. the closing tag: same as opening tag but includes a forward slash before the element name *standard beginner's error*
    3. the content
    4. the element: 1+2+3 = the element
        - attributes include info about the element i don't want to appear
        - should contain: space between it and the element name/previous attribute; attribute name followed by an equals sign; the attribute value wrapped by opening and closing quotation marks
    - Nesting elements: element within an element
    - Empty element: element with no content
- Anatomy of an HTML document
- Images
- Marking up text
    - Headings: <h1> through <h6>
    - Paragraphs: <p>
    - Lists: unordered <ul> and ordered <ol>
        - each item is put inside a <li>
    - Links: <a> insert text then close
