# HTML Links, JS Functions, and Intro to CSS Layout
## Links
- Example: <a href="https://twitter.com/gmeadiv">This is my twitter</a>
  - href is the address of the page i want the user to go to
  - the text between the tags is what the user will see and click on
  - absolute URLs are for linking to different websites
  - relative URLs are for linking to pages within the same site (eg my table of contents)

## Layout

## Functions, Methods, and Objects
- functions and methods: 
  - series of statements grouped together because they perform a specific task
  - method is the same as a function except that methods are created inside of an object
- objects
- built-in objects

## 6 Reasons for Pair Programming
- practice of two developers sharing a single workstation to interactively tackle a coding task together
- two roles:
  - driver: person typing
  - navigator: thinks about the big picture, what's next, how an algorithm might be converted into code, scans for bugs and typos
1. Greater efficiency
  - easier to catch mistakes in the moment
  - takes longer at first but produces higher quality code that needs less revision later
  - one programmer can take over when the other gets stuck
2. Engaged collaboration
  - programmers focus better with a partner around
  - less need for additional help
3. Learning from fellow students
  - exposes programmers to different techniques and ideas
4. Social skills
  - builds communication
  - forced to deal with different personalities
5. Job interview readiness
  - pairing an applicant with an employee is a common step during the interview process
6. Work environment readiness
  - employers expect to train fresh hires with pair programming
