# Reading Notes
## Introduction 
My name is George Mead. I served in the military for over seven years before going to college on the GI Bill. I'm learning computer programming because I want a fun job that pays well while still giving me the flexibility to enjoy life. My favorite hobby is playing the guitar and writing my own songs.
