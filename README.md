## Growth Mindset

*In my own words*

Having a growth mindset means understanding that we are able to improve ourselves rather than being shackled permanently to bad habits or personality traits

## Three Ways to Remind Myself to Stay within the Growth Mindset
1. I've already grown a lot, and I'm going to continue to grow
2. Growing pains are real, but no pain no gain as they say
3. Luck is when opportunity meets preparation, so prepare!

### I'm not sure how many features of Markdown structure I've used so
* **I'm going to experiment with different stuff**
* *such as **this***

## Choosing a text editor
### features to look for:
1. code completion
2. syntax highlighting
3. variety of themes
4. healthy selection of extensions

## The command line
## Basic navigation
* PWD = Print Working Directory (where am i?)
* LS = List (what is here?)
* Path = how to get from here to there
  * Absolute specifies a location in relation to the root directory (always begins with /)
  * Relative specified a location in relation to where i currently am (does *not* begin with a /)
  * ~ (tilde) is a shortcut for my home directory
  * . (dot) is a reference to my current directory
  * .. (dotdot) is a reference to the parent directory
* CD = Change Directory (gets me from here to there)
  * Tab Completion = auto complete
* Touch = create a new file
* MKIR = Make directory

## More abour files
* Quotes: anything inside is considered a single item
* \ (backslash): nullifies the meaning of the next character
* Hidden files and directories
  * if file or directory name begins with "." (dot) then it is hidden
  * LS command will not reveal hidden files unless modified by including command line option "-a"
