# Images, Color, Text

## Images
- Rules for creating images
  1. save images in the right format (jpeg, gif, png)
    - photographs are best saved as jpg
    - illustrations or logos with flat colors are better as gifs
  2. save images at the same height and width with which it will appear on the website
    - reducing the size maintains quality and improves load time
    - increasing size can distort the image and make it look blurry
    - changing the shape of the image may crop it or it could lose important info
  3. Measure images in pixels
