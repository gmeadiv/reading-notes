# State and Props

## Component Life Cycle Events
- Components are defined as classes or functions
- the methods we're able to use on these are called lifecycle events
- allows us to update the UI and application states
- Mounting: an instance of a component is created and inserted into DOM in this phase
- Updating: anytime a component is updated it is rerendered
- Unmounting: final phase of the lifecycle when the component is removed from DOM

## React: State v. Props
- state and props are the two different types of data
- Props are outside the component and can only be changed outside of the component
- state is already inside the component and can be changed inside the components
