# Diversity & Inclusion in the Tech Industry

## That Time When Women Stopped Coding
- What occured during the same time as the beginning of the decline of women in computer sciene?
  - more people started owning personal computers
  - those personal computers were mostly games and marketed almost exclusively to men and boys
- Why does it matter that males had been playing on computers growing up?
  - when those boys got to college/the workplace they were more proficient with computers

## Employee breakdown of key technology companies
- What three take-a-ways do you have looking at this data?
  - Tech is generally fairly representative of US demographics, although specific companies have a lot of work to do
  - interesting that, as a whole ,the tech industry is 51% women but only a handful of these top tech companies come close to approaching fifty percent women
  - qualifying observation #1: only the workers of these companies are representative of US demographics, Congress and the leadership of the Fortune 500 are still almost all men, mostly white.

## Why diversity matters to your tech company
- When are diversity efforts most successful? When they are driven by a commitment from company leaadership.
- Why do diverse companies perform better? More creative and onnovative.
- Give an example of how a diverse company can serve a diverse user base or vise-versa. I've read a lot about the racism of automated objects like sinks, soap dispensers, and air dryers that don't recognize darker skin tones and, thus, won't work properly. If a team consists of all fair-skinned people, it can be easy to miss that a product simply won't work for black people.
