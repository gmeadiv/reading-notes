# Programming with JavaScript
## Expressions and Operators
- Operators
    - binary: needs 1 operand before and 1 after the operator
    - unary: needs 1 operand either before or after the operator
    - operand is the variable
    - assignment operators gives a value to its left operand based on the value of its right operand
    - comparison operators compares its operands and returns a logical value based on whether the comparison is true
    - arithmetic operators take a numerical value as their operands and returns a single numerical value
    - bitwise operators treats operands as a set of 32 bits rather than decimal, hexadecimanl, or octal numbers

## Functions
- Defining Functions: function keyword followed by
    - the name of the function
    - a list of parameters to the function, enclosed in parantheses and separated by commas
    - the javascript statements that define the function, enclosed in curly brackets
- Calling functions
    - defining a function doesn't execute it
    - calling a function perdorms the specified actions with the indicated parameters
- Function Scope
    - variables defined within a function can't be accessed from outside of the function
    - a function defined in the global scope can access all variables defined in the global scope

## Control Flow
- the order in which the computer executes statements in a script
    - code is run from top to bottom unless it encounters loops and conditional statements

## JavaScript Functions
- a function is a block of code designed to perform a particular task
    - a function is executed when something invokes/calls it
    - function arguments are the values received by the function when it is invoked
    - other programming languages may call a function "procedure" or "subroutine"
    - functions can be used many times
- Function Return
    - function stops executing when it reaches a return statements

## JavaScript Operators
- Assignment operator assigns value to a variable
