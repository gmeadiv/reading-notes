# Lesson 6 reading notes
## What is JavaScript
- lightweight, interpreted, or "just in time" compiled programming language with first-class functions
- builds web pages but also other stuff like adobe acrobat!
- *NOT* the same as Java (but owned by the same company)

## Input/Output in plain JavaScript
- Three ways to describe a JavaScript variable
1. using: var
2. using: let
3. using: const
- Variables are containers for storing data (much like algebra)
- JavaScript Identifiers
    - all variables must be identified with unique names called identifiers
    - can be short or descriptive
    - can contain letters, digits, underscores, and dollar signs
    - usually always begins with a letter
    - can begin with $ or _
    - names are case sensitive!
    - reserved words (keywords) cannot be used as names
- The Assignment Operator
    - "=" means *assign* not *equals to*
- JavaScript Data Types
    - variables can hold numbers or text values called text strings
    - strings are written inside double or single quotes
    - numbers are written without quotes
    - numbers in quotes will be treated like text strings
- Declaring/Creating JavaScript Variables
    - use the "var" keyword to create the variable
    - use "=" to assign a value to the variable
    - best practice: declare all variables at the beginning of a script
    - can declare many variables in one statement
    - variables without a value are undefined
    - some variables need to be left undefined until the data is provided later
    - variables can be redeclared but it won't lose its value
    - can do arithmetic with variables
