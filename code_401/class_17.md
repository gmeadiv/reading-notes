# AWS: S3 and Lambda

## Describe “The Cloud”

Instead of one server managing all back-end functions and processes, each function/process is handled by a separate server. 

## What is a container (as it relates to computers and servers)?

A compute environment that contains everything needed to function on its own.

## What is auto-scaling?

A service that monitors your applications and automatically adjusts compute resources to maintain steady, predictable performance at the lowest possible cost.

## What is bandwidth?

The maximum rate at which data can transfer from one machine to another.

## How do cloud providers compute service costs?

Based on usage.

## Document the following Vocabulary Terms

- Server Instances: a virtual machine which runs our workloads in the cloud.

- Containers: A compute environment that contains everything needed to function on its own.

- Cloud Services: come from cloud providers.

- Cloud Architecture: how computing environments are designed.

- AWS: provides on-demand cloud computing platforms and APIs to on a metered pay-as-you-go basis, with a basic abstract technical infrastructure and distributed computing building blocks and tools.

- EC2/Beanstalk vs Heroku: Heroku’s pricing takes exponential price jumps as one adds common additional features such as auto-scaling. AWS pricing is fairly linear. In contrast, Heroku is generally simpler to get up and running. AWS has a fairly steep initial learning curve.
