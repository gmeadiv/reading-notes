## How to solve programming problems

### Common mistakes

- improper allocation of time
  - understand the problem before writing code
  - keep it simple

1. Read the problem completely twice.
2. Solve the problem manually with 3 sets of sample data.
3. Optimize the manual steps.
4. Write the manual steps as comments or pseudo-code.
5. Replace the comments or pseudo-code with real code.
6. Optimize the real code.

### Read the problem completely twice

- most important step
- read the problem many times when necessary
- if you can't understand the problem you can't solve it
- nothing can be automated that cannot be done manually

## How to think like a programmer â€” lessons in problem solving

1. Understand
2. Plan
3. Divide
4. Stuck? Practice.

## 5 Whys: Getting to the Root of a Problem Quickly

- used for troubleshooting, quality improvement, and problem solving
- Counterintuitively, 5 whys involves seven steps:
  1. assemble the avengers
  2. define the problem if you can
  3. ask the first why: why is the problem occurring?
  4. For each answer generated during step 3 ask 'why' four more times - not unlike a child who asks why repetitively
  5. Unlike the child, know when to stop asking why
- the five in 5 whys isn't really important
- go further than assigning blame
- develop countermeasures
  6. Address the Root Cause(s)
  7. Monitor your measures

### Node Runtime

- Runtime is a place for code to run
  - most of the time JS runs in the browser
  - somethings can be done only in the browser, some can be done in node
- Node has different concerns than the browser
  - Node gives the developer a lot more power
  - What is my computer doing (and other machines) > what is the browser displaying
